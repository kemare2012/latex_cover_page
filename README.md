## R Markdown PDF Generation with LaTeX and Two-Column Charts

This repository contains two R Markdown files that demonstrate PDF generation using LaTeX in RStudio.

## Files

*   **main.Rmd:** This file demonstrates how to create a PDF document with a cover page inserted using LaTeX.  The resulting PDF is `main.pdf`.
*   **two_column_charts.Rmd:** This file showcases the creation of two-column charts using several R packages, including `cowplot`. The resulting PDF is `two_column_charts.pdf`.

## Dependencies

The R Markdown files rely on the following R packages:

*   `knitr`
*   `rmarkdown`
*   `cowplot`
*   `ggplot2`
*   `ipsum` (for generating dummy text (lorem ipsum) in document)
*   `tinytex` (for LaTeX compilation)
